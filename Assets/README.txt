This will work with any Android phone above the specifications of the project, but it can also be run from within the editor.

To control the camera in the editor, hold the Alt key while moving the mouse to rotate the camera as in an FPS game, and hold Ctrl to tilt the camera about the viewing axis. Clicking the left mouse button mimics a single touch on the phone.
